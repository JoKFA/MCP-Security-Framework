# MCP Security Framework - Web View

A simple, secure web interface for viewing assessment reports generated by the MCP Security Framework.

## Features

- **Read-only access**: Only displays reports, never modifies them
- **Secure by default**: Binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) only
- **Independent operation**: Runs separately from the CLI tool
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface for viewing reports
- **Multiple formats**: View JSON and SARIF reports directly

## Installation

The web view requires Flask. Install it using:

```bash
pip install flask>=3.0.0
```

Or install all dependencies from pyproject.toml:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Start the web view server:

```bash
python web_view.py
```

Then open your browser to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Custom Port

Run on a different port:

```bash
python web_view.py --port 8080
```

### Custom Reports Directory

Point to a different reports directory:

```bash
python web_view.py --reports-dir ./my-reports
```

### Network Access (Not Recommended)

By default, the web view only binds to localhost for security. If you need network access (e.g., for remote viewing), you can bind to all interfaces:

```bash
python web_view.py --host 0.0.0.0
```

**Warning**: Only use `--host 0.0.0.0` if you understand the security implications. The web view has no authentication, so anyone on your network could access it.

## How It Works

1. The web view reads reports from the `reports/` directory (or a custom directory you specify)
2. It displays a list of all available assessment reports
3. Click on any report to view detailed information including:
   - Assessment metadata
   - Server profile information
   - Detection results with vulnerabilities
   - Signals and proof of concepts
   - Summary statistics

## Security Considerations

- **Localhost only**: By default, the server only accepts connections from localhost
- **Read-only**: The web view never modifies reports or files
- **Path traversal protection**: Input validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- **No authentication**: The web view is designed for local use only

## Integration with CLI

The web view is completely independent of the CLI tool. You can:

1. Run assessments using the CLI: `mcpsf assess <target>`
2. View results in the web interface: `python web_view.py`
3. Both tools can run simultaneously without conflicts

The CLI continues to work exactly as before - the web view is purely for visualization.

## API Endpoints

The web view also provides JSON API endpoints:

- `GET /api/reports` - List all reports
- `GET /api/report/<report_id>` - Get a specific report as JSON
- `GET /api/report/<report_id>/sarif` - Get SARIF format report

These can be useful for integration with other tools or scripts.
