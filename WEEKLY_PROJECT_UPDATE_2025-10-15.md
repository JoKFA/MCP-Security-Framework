# Weekly Project Update

**Project Title:** MCP Security Framework - Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tool for Model Context Protocol Servers
**Week #:** 3
**Date:** October 15, 2025

## 1. Summary
This week we completed the core security assessment framework (v0.2), transitioning from manual exploitation tools to a fully automated vulnerability scanner. We implemented 6 major framework components, built the first real detector (Prompt Injection via Resource Parameters), and successfully detected DV-MCP Challenge 1 with 95% confidence. All 80 unit tests and 1 integration test are passing with 100% coverage.

## 3. Key Learnings / Issues

### Technical Insights:
- **Pydantic AnyUrl Gotcha:** MCP SDK returns Pydantic `AnyUrl` objects for resource URIs, not Python strings. Calling `.startswith()` on these objects fails. Solution: Always convert to string with `str(resource.uri)`.
- **Rate Limiting Optimization:** Original design wasted rate limiter tokens on blocked requests. Moving scope validation before rate limit acquisition improved efficiency.
- **Signal Serialization:** Pydantic enums serialize to strings in JSON output. Test code must handle both `SignalType.SENSITIVE_EXPOSURE` (enum) and `"sensitive_exposure"` (string).
- **Datetime Timezone Awareness:** Python 3.13 deprecated `datetime.utcnow()`. Migrated to `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for future compatibility.

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Signal Bus Pattern:** Detectors emit normalized signals (reflection, auth_mismatch, error_signature, etc.) that can be consumed by a future correlator for multi-detector attack chain analysis.
- **SafeAdapter Wrapper:** Clean separation of concerns - business logic in detectors, safety enforcement in SafeAdapter.
- **Audit Logging with Integrity Verification:** Rolling hash in JSONL logs enables tamper detection.

### Development Process:
- **Comprehensive Testing First:** Writing 80 unit tests before integration testing caught 3 critical bugs early.
- **Manual Test Script:** Creating `test_detector_manual.py` significantly accelerated detector debugging.
- **Git Branch Strategy:** Using feature branch (`v0.2/First-PromptInjection-Improvement`) allowed safe experimentation without affecting main branch.

## 5. Blockers / Help Needed

### Current Blockers:
- âœ… **None!** All critical path items for Phase 2A/2B are complete.

### Future Considerations:
- **SARIF Schema Complexity (T7):** SARIF v2.1.0 spec is extensive. May need external library (`sarif-om` or `jschema-to-python`) for proper schema generation. **Request:** Mentor recommendation on SARIF library choice.
- **HTML Template Engine (T8):** Need to decide between Jinja2 (mature, heavy) vs simpler templating. **Request:** Feedback on template engine selection for security reports.
- **CLI Argument Structure (T9):** Designing subcommand hierarchy (`mcpsf assess`, `mcpsf replay`, `mcpsf report`). **Request:** Review CLI design before implementation.

### Resource Needs:
- **More Test Targets:** Currently testing only against DV-MCP challenges. Would benefit from additional vulnerable MCP servers for validation. **Request:** Recommendations for diverse MCP server test targets.
- **Evaluation Metrics Validation:** Using confidence scores (0.0-1.0) and signal counts. **Request:** Mentor feedback on detector evaluation methodology.
